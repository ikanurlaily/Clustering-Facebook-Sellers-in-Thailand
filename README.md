# Clustering Facebook Sellers in Thailand
Facebook Live has recently become a popular direct selling medium, notably in East and South-East Asia. This feature offers small, self-employed sellers unseen level of consumer reach and involvement and is reinventing direct selling. This study applied data analytics to social network dataset extracted from Facebook to explore user behaviours and effectiveness of Facebook live as a direct selling tool. The  results  affirm  the  strong  impact  that  Facebook  Live  usage  has  had  on  the  patterns,  statistical  structure and extent of consumer engagement as well as the virality of posts. Specifically, live videos generate more comments, emotional reaction, share, and time exposure suggesting higher cognitive, affective,  and  behavioural  engagement  with  sellers,  relative  to  other  types  of  Facebook  posts.  Implications and future research are also briefly discussed.

#### Data Set Information:
The variability of consumer engagement is analysed through a Principal Component Analysis, highlighting the changes induced by the use of Facebook Live. The seasonal component is analysed through a study of the averages of the different engagement metrics for different time-frames (hourly, daily and monthly). Finally, we identify statistical outlier posts, that are qualitatively analyzed further, in terms of their selling approach and activities.
